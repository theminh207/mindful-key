Surgical Changes
Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

When editing existing code:

Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.
The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.
